 <h2>About Me Kyle Wilson</h2>
 <p>Hi, I’m Kyle Wilson, a multimedia programming and design student at BMCC with a strong focus on UI/UX design. I’m passionate about creating intuitive, user-centered digital experiences that are both visually engaging and functional. My goal is to become a UI/UX designer at a major company, where I can continue learning and collaborating on impactful projects. Looking ahead, I aspire to eventually build my own company and bring my creative vision to life on a larger scale. </p>
